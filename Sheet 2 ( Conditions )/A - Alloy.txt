A - Alloy


Problem Statement
Takahashi melted and mixed AA grams of gold and BB grams of silver (0 \leq A,B,\ 0 \lt A+B)(0≤A,B, 0<A+B) to produce new metal.

What metal did he produce: pure gold, pure silver, or an alloy?

Formally, the product is called as follows.

Pure gold, if 0 \lt A0<A and B=0B=0.
Pure silver, if A=0A=0 and 0 \lt B0<B.
An alloy, if 0 \lt A0<A and 0 \lt B0<B.
Constraints
0 \leq A,B \leq 1000≤A,B≤100
1 \leq A+B1≤A+B
All values in input are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

AA BB
Output
If the product is pure gold, print Gold; if it is pure silver, print Silver; if it is an alloy, print Alloy.

Sample 1

50 50
Alloy
We have 0 \lt A0<A and 0 \lt B0<B, so the product is an alloy.

Sample 2
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
100 0
Gold
We have 0 \lt A0<A and B=0B=0, so the product is pure gold.

Sample 3

0 100
Silver
We have A=0A=0 and 0 \lt B0<B, so the product is pure silver.

Alloy



Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int A, B;
   cin >> A >> B;

   if ( A == 0 && B > 0 )
      cout << "Silver";
   else if (B == 0 && A > 0)
      cout << "Gold";
   else 
      cout << "Alloy";
}
