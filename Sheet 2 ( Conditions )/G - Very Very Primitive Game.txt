G - Very Very Primitive Game


Problem Statement
Takahashi and Aoki will play a game against each other.
Initially, Takahashi and Aoki have AA and BB candies, respectively.
They will alternately do the operation below. Takahashi goes first if C=0C=0, and Aoki goes first if C=1C=1.

Eat one of the candies he has.
The person who first becomes unable to do the operation loses. Which person will win?

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
0 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000≤ A,B≤100
C \in \{0, 1\}C∈{0,1}
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

AA BB CC
Output
If Takahashi will win, print Takahashi; if Aoki will win, print Aoki.

Sample 1
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
2 1 0
Takahashi
Initially, Takahashi and Aoki have 22 and 11 candy(ies), respectively. The game will proceed as follows:

Takahashi eats his candy.
Aoki eats his candy.
Takahashi eats his candy.
Aoki has no more candies, so Takahashi wins.

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int A, B, C;
   cin >> A >> B >> C;
   
   if (C == 0)
   {
      if (A <= B)
         cout << "Aoki";
      else
         cout << "Takahashi";
   }
   else if (C==1)
   {
      if (A >= B)
         cout << "Takahashi";
      else
         cout << "Aoki";
   }

}
