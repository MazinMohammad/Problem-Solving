I - Rainy Season


Problem Statement
We have weather records at AtCoder Town for some consecutive three days. A string of length 33, SS, represents the records - if the ii-th character is S, it means it was sunny on the ii-th day; if that character is R, it means it was rainy on that day.

Find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days in this period.

Constraints
|S| = 3∣S∣=3
Each character of SS is S or R.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

SS
Output
Print the maximum number of consecutive rainy days in the period.

Sample 1
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
RRS
2
We had rain on the 11-st and 22-nd days in the period. Here, the maximum number of consecutive rainy days is 22, so we should print 22.

Sample 2
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
SSS
0
It was sunny throughout the period. We had no rainy days, so we should print 00.

Sample 3
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
RSR
1
We had rain on the 11-st and 33-rd days - two "streaks" of one rainy day, so we should print 11.


Solution:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   string s;
   cin >> s;

   if (s=="SSS")
      cout << 0;
   else if (s=="SSR" || s=="SRS" || s=="RSS"|| s=="RSR")
      cout << 1;
   else if (s=="SRR"  || s=="RRS")
      cout << 2;
   else if (s=="RRR")
      cout << 3;
}
