C - Palindromic Number


Problem Statement
You are given a three-digit positive integer NN.
Determine whether NN is a palindromic number.
Here, a palindromic number is an integer that reads the same backward as forward in decimal notation.

Constraints
100≤N≤999100≤N≤999
NN is an integer.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

NN
Output
If NN is a palindromic number, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample 1
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
575
Yes
N=575N=575 is also 575575 when read backward, so it is a palindromic number. You should print Yes.

Sample 2
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
123
No
N=123N=123 becomes 321321 when read backward, so it is not a palindromic number. You should print No.

Sample 3
Inputcopy	Outputcopy
812
No



Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int n;
   cin >> n;

   if (n/10/10 == n%10)
      cout << "Yes";
   else
      cout << "No";

}
