D - Day of Takahashi


Problem Statement
In AtCoder Kingdom, Gregorian calendar is used, and dates are written in the "year-month-day" order, or the "month-day" order without the year.
For example, May 33, 20182018 is written as 20182018-55-33, or 55-33 without the year.

In this country, a date is called Takahashi when the month and the day are equal as numbers. For example, 55-55 is Takahashi.

bb is an integer between 11 and 3131 (inclusive).
