H - AtCoder Quiz 2


Problem Statement
In the Kingdom of AtCoder, there is a standardized test of competitive programming proficiency.

An examinee will get a score out of 100100 and obtain a rank according to the score, as follows:

Novice, for a score not less than 00 but less than 4040;
Intermediate, for a score not less than 4040 but less than 7070;
Advanced, for a score not less than 7070 but less than 9090;
Expert, for a score not less than 9090.
Takahashi took this test and got XX points.

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int X;
   cin >> X;

   if (X>=0 && X < 40)
      cout << 40 - X;
   else if (X>=40 && X < 70)
      cout << 70 - X;
   else if (X>=70 && X < 90)
      cout << 90 - X;
   else
      cout << "expert";
}
