D - Three Dice

Problem Statement
Takahashi has rolled three dice. They are showing numbers aa, bb, and cc on the top faces.

Find the sum of the numbers on the bottom faces.

Here, each of these dice is a standard cubic die, where the sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 77.

Constrains
1 \leq a, b, c \leq 61≤a,b,c≤6
All values in input are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

aa bb cc
Output
Print the sum of the numbers on the bottom faces of the three dice.

Sample 1

1 4 3
13
The numbers on the bottom faces are 66, 33, and 44. We have 6 + 3 + 4 = 136+3+4=13, which should be printed.

Sample 2

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int a, b, c;
   cin >> a >> b >> c;

   cout << (7-a) + (7-b) + (7-c) ;
}
