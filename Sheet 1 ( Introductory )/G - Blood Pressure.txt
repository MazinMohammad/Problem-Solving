G - Blood Pressure

Problem Statement
You are given a person's systolic blood pressure, AA, and diastolic blood pressure, BB.
Find the mean arterial pressure, CC, which we define as follows:

C = \frac{A-B}{3} +BC= 
3
A−B
​
 +B.
Constraints
50 \leq B \leq A \leq 30050≤B≤A≤300
All values in input are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

AA BB
Output
Print the value CC.
Your output is considered correct when its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-5}10 
−5
 .

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int A, B;
   cin >> A >> B;

   float C = (A-B)/3.0 + B;
   cout << C;
}
