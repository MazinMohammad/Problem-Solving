The denominations for dollar bills are 11, 55, 1010, 2020, 100100. What is the minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his entire balance?

9
 ).

Note
In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a 100100 dollar bill, a 2020 dollar bill, and a 55 dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive 125125 dollars in one or two bills.

In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two 2020 dollar bills and three 11 dollar bills.

In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw 100000000100000000 (ten million!) 100100 dollar bills.


Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int n;
   cin >> n;

   int c;

   while (n>=100)
   {
      n-=100;
      c++;
   }
   while (n < 100 && n >= 20)
   {
      n-=20;
      c++;
   }
   while (n < 20 && n >= 10)
   {
      n-=10;
      c++;
   }
   while (n<10 && n>=5)
   {
      n-=5;
      c++;
   }
   while (n>0 && n<5)
   {
      n-=1;
      c++;
   }

   cout << c;
}
