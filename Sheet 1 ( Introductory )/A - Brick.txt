A - Brick

Problem Statement:
We have a truck, which can carry at most N kilograms.
We will load bricks onto this truck, each of which weighs W kilograms. At most how many bricks can be loaded?

Constraints:
1≤N,W≤1000
N and W are integers.

Input:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N W

Output:
Print an integer representing the maximum number of bricks that can be loaded onto the truck.

10 3		3

Each brick weighs 33 kilograms, so 3 bricks weigh 9 kilograms, and 4 weigh 12 kilograms.
Thus, we can load at most 3 bricks onto the truck that can carry at most 10 kilograms.

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n, w;

    cin >> n >> w;

    int max;

   while (n%w != 0)
    n--;

     
    max = n/w;
    
    cout << max; 
    
}
