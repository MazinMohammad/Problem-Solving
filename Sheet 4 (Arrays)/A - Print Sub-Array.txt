A - Print Sub-Array

You are given an array AA of nn integers as input. Also, you are given two integers, ll and rr, and you have to print the subarray [ll,…,rr] (sub-array of AA from position ll to position rr).

Input:
First line will contain nn, the number of elements of array.
Second line will contain array AA of nn integers.
Third line will contain two integers, ll and rr.
Output:
Print the subarray of AA, from position ll to position rr.

Constraints:
1 \leq n \leq 10^61≤n≤10

1 \leq l \leq r \leq n1≤l≤r≤n
Sample Input:
4
2 3 -1 2
1 3
Sample Output:
2 3 -1
Explanation:
The sub-array from position 11 to position 33 is 22 33 -1−1

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n, l, r;
    cin >> n;
    int *ptr = new int[n+1]();

    for (int i = 1; i<n+1; i++)
        cin >> ptr[i];
    

    cin >> l >> r;

    for (int i = l; i<=r; i++)
        cout << ptr[i] << " ";
}
